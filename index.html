It's great to have you here. 
<br><br>
I received my Ph.D. from <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC</a>, where I was lucky to work with Professors <a
	href="https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~jcarlsso/" target="_blank">John Carlsson</a> and <a
	href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Ross/Sheldon" target="_blank">Sheldon Ross</a>. 
My Ph.D. research focused on online learning, reinforcement learning, and routing problems.
I was also a research intern at <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/" target="_blank">Google Research</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.science/" target="_blank">Amazon Science</a> working on the NLP and ranking projects.
Currently, I work on foundation models alignment and instruction tuning for assistant agents at Google. 
<br><br>

My current research interests revolve around <b>foundation models and reinforcement learning</b>. 
<br><br>

In addition to my career pursuits, I'm also an avid hiker and volleyball player. I also enjoy watching historical and mystery movies in my free time.
